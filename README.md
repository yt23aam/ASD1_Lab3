Visualisation and Repository

1. Attached are files with annual share price data for four companies traded on the London
   Stock Exchange. Annual returns are the relative change of the share prices over the year
   in percent. The stocks are Barclays (BCS), BP, Tesco (TSCO) and Vodaphone (VOD) all
   part of the FTSE100 index of the 100 largest listed companies.
   * Produce normalised histograms of the returns. Arrange them as subplots. To save
     space do not use titles, but use labels to display the company names.
     
   * Pick two stocks and create a combined histogram of both. Use transparency to make
     both histograms fully visible.
     
   * Produce a boxplot of the return distributions of the four companies with names of
     the companies as labels.
     
   Save your figures as PNG files.
2. The table shows the market capitalisation of the four companies. Market capitalisation is
   the value of a company and is calculated by multiplying the number of shares with the
   share price.
